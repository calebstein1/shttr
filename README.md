# :toilet: Shttr CLI :toilet:

Shttr CLI is the CLI tool for managing your Shttr apps. Install by adding `shttr` and `shttr-dbg` to your $PATH.

Learn more at [shttr.io](https://shttr.io), or see the [sh-on-the-shttr](https://github.com/calebstein1/sh-on-the-shttr) repo for the server side.

Shttr CLI depends on rsync for deploying Shttr apps, and git for updates.

Sassc is an optional dependency which allows Shttr CLI to support scss files in addition to vanilla css.
